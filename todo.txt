Notes

+ Write code for testing each endpoint after authorised  (Do this in a loop)

Reasoning Steps: 
- I need to be able to see all of my pokemon
- I need to see if my pokemons type is good against the opponent
  - How deep do we go? ... keep it high level to start
- I need to know what moves my pokemon has and the types, to see if they work well
  - Do we do this in one step? 
- I need to see the status effects or if they are fainted 


+ Write hardcoded flow to mimic LLM 
+ Note down what reasoning steps are required for analysis
+ Implement Analysis Agent
+ Implement Battle Agent
+ Implement Reasoning Agent
